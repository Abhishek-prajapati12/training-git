	<h1>What is Metaverse?</h1>
  <p>
    The term "metaverse" originated in the 1992 science fiction novel Snow Crash, as a portmanteau of "meta" and "universe".[5][6][page needed] Metaverse development is often linked to advancing virtual reality technology due to increasing demands for immersion.[7][8][9] Recent interest in metaverse development is influenced by Web3,[10][11] a concept for a decentralized iteration of the internet. Web3 and the Metaverse have been used as buzzwords[1][12] to exaggerate development progress of various related technologies and projects for public relations purposes.[13] Information privacy, user addiction, and user safety are concerns within the metaverse, stemming from challenges facing the social media and video game industries as a whole.
